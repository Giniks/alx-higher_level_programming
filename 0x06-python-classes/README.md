# Python Class and Object

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of Python classes and objects. The key areas covered include:

- **Classes and Objects:** Understanding the blueprint for creating objects (instances of a class).
- **Methods:** Defining functions within a class that describe the behaviors of the objects.
- **Functionalities:** Implementing the actions and operations that objects of a class can perform.
- **Variables and Attributes:** Differentiating between variables within the class (class attributes) and those associated with the instance (instance attributes).
- **Instances:** Creating and managing instances of a class.
- **Access Modifiers:** Exploring how to control the accessibility of class members using public, private, and protected attributes and methods.
