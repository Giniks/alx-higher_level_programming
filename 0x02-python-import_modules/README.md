# Python - Import and Modules

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to import functions from different files and modules in Python. The project includes:

1. Importing functions from an `add` file and a `calculator` module.
2. Creating a program that imports some variables and prints their values.
3. Handling and printing arguments and results.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd 0x02-python-import_modules
   ```

## Usage

### Importing Functions

You can import functions from the `add` file and `calculator` module as shown in the examples below.

#### Example from `add.py`

```python
from add import add_function

result = add_function(5, 3)
print("Addition Result:", result)
```

#### Example from `calculator.py`

```python
from calculator import multiply_function

result = multiply_function(4, 2)
print("Multiplication Result:", result)
```

### Importing Variables

You can import variables and print their values as shown below.

#### Example from `variables.py`

```python
from variables import var1, var2

print("Variable 1:", var1)
print("Variable 2:", var2)
```

### Handling Arguments

The program can handle arguments and print results as follows.

#### Example of Handling Arguments

```python
import sys

def main(args):
    for arg in args:
        print("Argument:", arg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(sys.argv[1:])
```
