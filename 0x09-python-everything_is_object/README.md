# Project Title: Python - Everything is Object

## Overview

In this project, I explored various concepts fundamental to Python's object model. Key topics covered include:

- **Objects**: Understanding what constitutes an object in Python.
- **Mutable and Immutable Types**: Differentiating between mutable and immutable data types and their implications.
- **Aliasing**: Examining how aliases affect object references.
- **Assignment**: How assignment operations work in Python.
- **References**: The concept of references and their role in Python.
- **Instances and Classes**: Exploring object-oriented programming with instances and classes.
- **Identical and Linked Variables**: Identifying when variables point to the same object and understanding linked variables.
- **Identifiers**: The role of identifiers in Python programming.
- **Built-in Mutables and Immutables**: Working with Python's built-in mutable and immutable types.

The project primarily consists of a question and answer section to further elaborate on these concepts.

## Acknowledgement

I want to express my gratitude to the ALX community for their exceptional organization of resources and projects. Your support and resources have been invaluable in advancing my understanding of these concepts.
