Project Title: JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

Project Overview: 

This JavaScript project focuses on working with objects, scopes, and closures. It includes a set of tasks that involve defining classes, working with functions, and manipulating data structures.

Project Description:

TASK O:
0-rectangle.js: Defines an empty class Rectangle. 

TASK1:
1-rectangle.js: Defines a class Rectangle with a constructor to initialize width and height. 

TASK2: 
2-rectangle.js: Builds upon 1-rectangle.js, handling cases where width and height are less than or equal to 0. 

TASK3:
3-rectangle.js: Adds a print() method to print the rectangle using the X character. 

TASK4:
4-rectangle.js: Extends Rectangle with rotate() and double() methods. 

TASK5:
5-square.js: Defines a class Square that inherits from Rectangle. 

TASK6:
6-square.js: Extends Square with a charPrint(c) method. 

TASK7:
7-occurrences.js: Contains a JavaScript function that returns the number of occurrences in a list. 

TASK8:
8-esrever.js: Contains a JavaScript function that reverses a list. 

TASK9:
9-logme.js: Contains a JavaScript function to print the number of arguments already printed along with the new argument value. 

TASK10: 
10-converter.js: Contains a JavaScript function to convert a number from base 10 to another base.

NOTE:

The project includes a set of tasks that involve working with classes, functions, and data manipulation. Each task is implemented in a separate JavaScript file.

You can refer to the Function Prototypes section for details on each task's function prototype.

Usage:
To use any of the functions or classes defined in this project, you can import the respective JavaScript file into your application.

Task 11:
100-map.js:  Contains a JavaScript function to mports an array from `100-data.js` and computes a new array using the `map` function. In the new array, each value is equal to the value of the initial list multiplied by its index in the list. It prints both the initial list and the new list. Use this command "./100-map.js command to run the script,. 

TASK12: 
101-sorted.js: Contains JavaScript function  that imports a dictionary of occurrences by user id from `101-data.js` and computes a new dictionary of user ids by occurrence. In the new dictionary, each key represents the number of occurrences, and the corresponding value is a list of user ids. The script prints the new dictionary at the end. Use ./101-sorted.js command  to run the script. 

TASK13: 
102-concat.js: Contains a JavaScript that concatenates the contents of two source files into a destination file. It takes three arguments: the file path of the first source file, the file path of the second source file, and the file path of the destination file. It is used to merge the content of two files.
Use ./102-concat.js fileA fileB fileC command to run the script.
