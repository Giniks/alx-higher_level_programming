Project Title: JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

Project Overview: 

This JavaScript project focuses on working with objects, scopes, and closures. It includes a set of tasks that involve defining classes, working with functions, and manipulating data structures.

Project Description:

TASK O:
0-rectangle.js: Defines an empty class Rectangle. 

TASK1:
1-rectangle.js: Defines a class Rectangle with a constructor to initialize width and height. 

TASK2: 
2-rectangle.js: Builds upon 1-rectangle.js, handling cases where width and height are less than or equal to 0. 

TASK3:
3-rectangle.js: Adds a print() method to print the rectangle using the X character. 

TASK4:
4-rectangle.js: Extends Rectangle with rotate() and double() methods. 

TASK5:
5-square.js: Defines a class Square that inherits from Rectangle. 

TASK6:
6-square.js: Extends Square with a charPrint(c) method. 

TASK7:
7-occurrences.js: Contains a JavaScript function that returns the number of occurrences in a list. 

TASK8:
8-esrever.js: Contains a JavaScript function that reverses a list. 

TASK9:
9-logme.js: Contains a JavaScript function to print the number of arguments already printed along with the new argument value. 

TASK10: 
10-converter.js: Contains a JavaScript function to convert a number from base 10 to another base.

NOTE:

The project includes a set of tasks that involve working with classes, functions, and data manipulation. Each task is implemented in a separate JavaScript file.

You can refer to the Function Prototypes section for details on each task's function prototype.

Usage:
To use any of the functions or classes defined in this project, you can import the respective JavaScript file into your application.
