Project Title: Python more classes and object. 


Overview

In this task, we will look into one more instances of Object and Class. we are taking 'rectangle' as the instance. This project will look into the definition, attributes, methods as well as level of access (private and public).


Project Description:

0-rectangle.py

Creates an emply class called Rectangle and pass.

1-rectangle.py

Based on (0-rectangle.py), I created an object from the class and initualized it by giving a values in respect to private imstance attribute. I also used getter() and setter() to retrieve a specific or relavant info according to the subject matter. 
Also i testes all exceptions and conditions.


2-rectangle.py

Based on (1-rectangle.py), I also included the area of the Rectqngle, also I initialized the width and the height atrribute to Null before returning the rectangle area and perimeter. 

3-rectangle.py

Based on (2-rectangle.py),I printed the string reprsentation of the rectangle in human language to aid readability for the end users. 

4-rectangle.py

Based on (3-rectangle.py), the string was evaluated using the repr function. Special method `__repr__` to return a string.

5-rectangle.py

Based on (4-rectangle.py), we detected for instance delete by using a Special method `__del__` that prints the message `Bye rectangle...` when a `Rectangle` is deleted.

6-rectangle.py

Based on (5-rectangle.py), I looked at number of instances for public classs attribute by initializing to zero.incremented for each new instantiation, and decremened for each instance deletion.

7-rectangle.py

Based on (6-rectangle.py), I used '#' as string representation yo print symbol. 

8-rectangle.py

Based on (7-rectangle.py), I incorporated static method that returns the rectangle with a greater area. 

9-rectangle.py

Based on (8-rectangle.py), I used class method define new rwctangke size(width and height).
