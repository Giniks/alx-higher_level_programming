Project Overview/Title : Python Hello World
This first project is to build my first python script that will enable me to print output. I will run my first script and codes in python.

Prerequisites and Possible Installation
I will write and modify my codes/scripts through the text editor (vi). This shell script will be tested in ubuntu 20.04LTS. All my script will be exactly two lines and all my files will end with a new line. I will start my first line of code with #!/bin/bash showing my path. And all my files must be executable.
